# rust_bindgen_cmathlib

A simple example project demonstrating how to call C code from Rust using **FFI (Foreign Function Interface)**. This project is a minimal and educational implementation designed to help understand how Rust can interoperate with C libraries — including compiling C code, generating bindings, and writing safe Rust wrappers.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This project provides a clear, concise, and working example of:

- Defining basic C functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) in a standalone math library.
- Using the [`cc`](https://crates.io/crates/cc) crate to compile C source files during the Rust build process.
- Automatically generating Rust FFI bindings from C header files using [`bindgen`](https://crates.io/crates/bindgen).
- Wrapping unsafe C calls in safe, idiomatic Rust functions.
- Structuring a Rust project that interoperates cleanly with external C code.

This project can be used as a base for more advanced FFI scenarios involving complex types, third-party C libraries, or integrating legacy systems into a Rust codebase.
